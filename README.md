# ðŸ¦™ Chat with Document - Using LangChain and Llama

This project allows you to upload a PDF document and chat with it using a chatbot built with LangChain and the `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` model. The chatbot can answer queries based on the document's content and maintain conversational context.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload any PDF file, and the chatbot will extract information from it.
- **Conversational Context**: The chatbot remembers previous queries and provides context-aware answers.
- **Vector Embedding**: Uses HuggingFaceEmbeddings to convert document content into vectors and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient search.
- **Conversational Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive interface.
- **Llama Model**: Uses the `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` model for answering user queries based on the document content.
